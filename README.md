# Event App 

## Welcome :wave:

Due to a lack of a better name, the project is called "Event App" :sweat_smile:

Unhappy with the way we currently organize events with our friends, I thought about how can I improve that for myself and my friends. I brought on [Darian](https://github.com/darianngo) to help me bring my idea to fruition.

Currently our Frontend is in a separate private repository.

The following is a mock I created for real-world acceptance testing.

This README.md will be updated accordingly.

Thank you for looking!
